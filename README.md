In 2003, the EPA implemented a program to reduce excessive NOx emissions in states deemed to be overproducing Nitrogen-oxide. 

In our analysis of the data, we found that the plan effectively reduced the amount of NOx for participating states post 2003 when the plan was implemented. We start by breaking down the analysis by comparing the NBP states vs. non-NBP states in the post period, specifically during summer months. 

We find that the NBP states in post-treatment summer periods have lower NOx emissions compared to non-NBP states in post-treatment summer periods. Moreover, our triple-difference comparison upholds this finding across groups and across time. 

Creating a calculation for the total NBP reduced between 2003-2007 can be found by multiplying the coefficient over the duration of time observed. 4 years * -0.331 = -1.32 change in NOx emissions over the 4 years following the treatment.
